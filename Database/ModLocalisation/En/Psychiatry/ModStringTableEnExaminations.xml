        <Text>Requires advanced diagnosis. Polysomnography (PSG) system monitors breathing, arterial oxygen saturation, electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, and other indicators continuously during the night to detect sleep abnormalities and diagnose sleep disorders, especially sleep-related breathing disorders. Although PSG can reflect the condition of patients with chronic insomnia, the diagnosis of chronic insomnia mainly relies on the subjective report of patients. PSG is only used as a means to exclude other sleep disorders, rather than a routine examination for insomnia.</Text>

        <Text>By sampling cerebrospinal fluid, this test determines whether the concentration of orexin-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid is ≤100 pg/ml or lower than 1/3 of the normal value, used to diagnose typical episodes of narcolepsy with cataplexy. It is particularly beneficial for patients who are difficult to undergo MSLT due to cost or inability to cooperate with the examination, and who are using psychotropic drugs and are difficult to discontinue.</Text>
